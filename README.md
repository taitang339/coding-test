If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? Would you implement anything differently? Please provide your comments in the README.

If i were to be given more time these are some of the things i would improve on 

- The styling. I would want to improve on how the page look, maybe add a slide design in order to showcase the picture more since the cards are little small. 
- Refractoring/cleanup. I can split some of the code into another component  to make the code a little more clean. 
- Error handling. A better way to handle error to make it more user friendly/more readable.
- General look and feel of the page. 
- Formatting.
